    """ 
    The Zig Zag indicator plots points on the chart whenever prices reverse by or greater than
    a pre-chosen variable. Straight lines are then drawn, connecting these points. The indicator
    is used to help identify price trends. It eliminates random price fluctuations and attempts
    to show trend changes. Zig Zag lines only appear when there is a price movement between a
    swing high and a swing low that is greater than a specified variable.
